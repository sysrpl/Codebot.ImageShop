## What is Image Shop?
Image Shop is a cross platform teaching application that allows students to write programming functions and see the results.

After a student writes a function, they can run the Image Shop program, drop their image function on a canvas, and visually connect it to other functions or images. Many functions can be combined to create new and interesteing image effects

This program is part of a greater computer programming studies course taught to children using resources and tools from the [getlazarus website](https://www.getlazarus.org/learn/).
